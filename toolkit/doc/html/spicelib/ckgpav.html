<h4><a name="Detailed_Input">Detailed_Input</a></h4>
<PRE>
     INST     is the NAIF integer ID for the instrument, spacecraft,
              or other structure for which pointing and angular
              velocity are requested. For brevity we will refer to
              this object as the &quot;instrument,&quot; and the frame fixed
              to this object as the &quot;instrument frame&quot; or
              &quot;instrument-fixed&quot; frame.

     SCLKDP   is the encoded spacecraft clock time for which
              pointing and angular velocity are requested.

              The SPICELIB routines <a href="scencd.html">SCENCD</a> and <a href="sce2c.html">SCE2C</a> respectively
              convert spacecraft clock strings and ephemeris time to
              encoded spacecraft clock. The inverse conversions are
              performed by <a href="scdecd.html">SCDECD</a> and <a href="sct2e.html">SCT2E</a>.

     TOL      is a time tolerance in ticks, the units of encoded
              spacecraft clock time.

              The SPICELIB routine <a href="sctiks.html">SCTIKS</a> converts a spacecraft
              clock tolerance duration from its character string
              representation to ticks. <a href="scfmt.html">SCFMT</a> performs the inverse
              conversion.

              The C-matrix - angular velocity vector pair returned by
              <b>CKGPAV</b> is the one whose time tag is closest to SCLKDP
              and within TOL units of SCLKDP. (More in $Particulars,
              below.)

              In general, because using a non-zero tolerance
              affects selection of the segment from which the
              data is obtained, users are strongly discouraged
              from using a non-zero tolerance when reading CKs
              with continuous data. Using a non-zero tolerance
              should be reserved exclusively to reading CKs with
              discrete data because in practice obtaining data
              from such CKs using a zero tolerance is often not
              possible due to time round off.

     REF      is the desired reference frame for the returned
              pointing and angular velocity. The returned C-matrix
              CMAT gives the orientation of the instrument
              designated by INST relative to the frame designated by
              REF. When a vector specified relative to frame REF is
              left-multiplied by CMAT, the vector is rotated to the
              frame associated with INST. The returned angular
              velocity vector AV expresses the angular velocity of
              the instrument designated by INST relative to the
              frame designated by REF. See the discussion of CMAT
              and AV below for details.

              Consult the SPICE document &quot;Frames&quot; for a discussion
              of supported reference frames.
</PRE>
<h4><a name="Detailed_Output">Detailed_Output</a></h4>
<PRE>
     CMAT     is a rotation matrix that transforms the components of
              a vector expressed in the reference frame specified by
              REF to components expressed in the frame tied to the
              instrument, spacecraft, or other structure at time
              CLKOUT (see below).

              Thus, if a vector v has components x,y,z in the REF
              reference frame, then v has components x',y',z' in the
              instrument fixed frame at time CLKOUT:

                 .-   -.     .-        -. .-   -.
                 |  x' |     |          | |  x  |
                 |  y' |  =  |   CMAT   | |  y  |
                 |  z' |     |          | |  z  |
                 '-   -'     '-        -' '-   -'

              If you know x', y', z', use the transpose of the
              C-matrix to determine x, y, z as follows:

                 .-   -.      .-        -.T  .-   -.
                 |  x  |      |          |   |  x' |
                 |  y  |  =   |   CMAT   |   |  y' |
                 |  z  |      |          |   |  z' |
                 '-   -'      '-        -'   '-   -'

                         (Transpose of CMAT)

     AV       is the angular velocity vector. This is the axis about
              which the reference frame tied to the instrument is
              rotating in the right-handed sense at time CLKOUT. The
              magnitude of AV is the magnitude of the instantaneous
              velocity of the rotation, in radians per second.  AV
              is expressed relative to the frame designated by REF.

     CLKOUT   is the encoded spacecraft clock time associated with
              the returned C-matrix and the returned angular
              velocity vector. This value may differ from the
              requested time, but never by more than the input
              tolerance TOL.

              The $Particulars section below describes the search
              algorithm used by <b>CKGPAV</b> to satisfy a pointing
              request. This algorithm determines the pointing
              instance (and therefore the associated time value)
              that is returned.

     FOUND    is .TRUE. if a record was found to satisfy the pointing
              request. FOUND will be .FALSE. otherwise.

     How the tolerance argument is used
     ==================================


     Reading a type 1 CK segment (discrete pointing instances)
     ---------------------------------------------------------

     In the diagram below

        - &quot;0&quot; is used to represent discrete pointing instances
          (quaternions, angular velocity vectors, and associated
          time tags).

        - &quot;( )&quot; are used to represent the end points of the time
          interval covered by a segment in a CK file.

        - SCLKDP is the time at which you requested pointing.
          The location of SCLKDP relative to the time tags of the
          pointing instances is indicated by the &quot;+&quot; sign.

        - TOL is the time tolerance specified in the pointing
          request. The square brackets &quot;[ ]&quot; represent the
          endpoints of the time interval

             SCLKDP-TOL : SCLKDP+TOL

        - The quaternions occurring in the segment need not be
          evenly spaced in time.


     Case 1:  pointing is available
     ------------------------------

                              SCLKDP
                                   \   TOL

                         <b>CKGPAV</b> returns this instance.


     Case 2:  pointing is not available

                         <b>CKGPAV</b> returns no pointing; the output
                         FOUND flag is set to .FALSE.



     Reading a type 2, 3, 4, or 5 CK segment (continuous pointing)
     -------------------------------------------------------------

     In the diagrams below

        - &quot;==&quot; is used to represent periods of continuous pointing.

        - &quot;--&quot; is used to represent gaps in the pointing coverage.

        - &quot;( )&quot; are used to represent the end points of the time
          interval covered by a segment in a CK file.

        - SCLKDP is the time at which you requested pointing.
          The location of SCLKDP relative to the time tags of the
          pointing instances is indicated by the &quot;+&quot; sign.

        - TOL is the time tolerance specified in the pointing
          request. The square brackets &quot;[ ]&quot; represent the
          endpoints of the time interval

             SCLKDP-TOL : SCLKDP+TOL

        - The quaternions occurring in the periods of continuous
          pointing need not be evenly spaced in time.


     Case 1:  pointing is available at the request time
     --------------------------------------------------

                             SCLKDP
                                   \   TOL
                                    | /

                                    |

                   The request time lies within an interval where
                   continuous pointing is available. <b>CKGPAV</b> returns
                   pointing at the requested epoch.


     Case 2:  pointing is available &quot;near&quot; the request time
     ------------------------------------------------------

                                    SCLKDP

     Tolerance and segment priority
     ==============================

     <b>CKGPAV</b> searches through loaded C-kernels to satisfy a pointing
     request. Last-loaded files are searched first. Individual files
     are searched in backwards order, so that between competing
     segments (segments containing data for the same object, for
     overlapping time ranges), the one closest to the end of the file
     has highest priority. <b>CKGPAV</b> considers only those segments that
     contain both pointing and angular velocity data, as indicated by
     the segment descriptor.

     The search ends when a segment is found that can provide pointing
     and angular velocity for the specified instrument at a time
     falling within the specified tolerance on either side of the
     request time. Within that segment, the instance closest to the
     input time is located and returned.

     The following four cases illustrate this search procedure.
     Segments A and B are in the same file, with segment A located
     further towards the end of the file than segment B. Both segments
     A and B contain discrete pointing data, indicated by the number
     0.


     Case 1:  Pointing is available in the first segment searched.
              Because segment A has the highest priority and can
              satisfy the request, segment B is not searched.

     Segments that contain continuous pointing data are searched in
     the same manner as segments containing discrete pointing data.
     For request times that fall within the bounds of continuous
     intervals, <b>CKGPAV</b> will return pointing at the request time. When
     the request time does not fall within an interval, then a time at
     an endpoint of an interval may be returned if it is the closest
     time in the segment to the user request time and is also within
     the tolerance.

     In the following examples, segment A is located further towards
     the end of the file than segment C. Segment A contains discrete
     pointing data and segment C contains continuous data, indicated
     by the &quot;=&quot; character.


     Case 3:  Pointing is not available in the first segment searched.
              Because segment A cannot satisfy the request, segment C
              is searched.

     In the next case, assume that the order of segments A and C in the
     file is reversed: A is now closer to the front, so data from
     segment C are considered first.


     Case 4:  Pointing is available in the first segment searched.

              satisfy the request, segment A is not searched.

     The next case illustrates an unfortunate side effect of using
     a non-zero tolerance when reading multi-segment CKs with
     continuous data. In all cases when the look-up interval
     formed using tolerance overlaps a segment boundary and
     the request time falls within the coverage of the lower
     priority segment, the data at the end of the higher priority
     segment will be picked instead of the data from the lower
     priority segment.


     Case 5:  Pointing is available in the first segment searched.
              Because segment C has the highest priority and can
              satisfy the request, segment A is not searched.

     The numerical results shown for this example may differ across
     platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as
     input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine
     specific arithmetic implementation.

     1) The following example program uses <b>CKGPAV</b> to get C-matrices
        and associated angular velocity vectors for a set of images
        whose SCLK counts (un-encoded character string versions) are
        known.

        For each C-matrix, a unit pointing vector is constructed and
        printed along with the angular velocity vector.

        Note: if the C-kernels of interest do not contain angular
        velocity data, then the SPICELIB routine <a href="ckgp.html">CKGP</a> should be used
        to read the pointing data. An example program in the header
        of the SPICELIB routine <a href="ckgp.html">CKGP</a> demonstrates this.

        We need to load also an SCLK kernel to convert from clock
        string to 'ticks.' Although not required for older spacecraft
        clocks, most modern spacecraft ones require a leapseconds
        kernel to be loaded in addition to an SCLK kernel.


        Use the meta-kernel shown below to load the required SPICE
        kernels.

        Updated to save the input frame name and <a href="pool.html">POOL</a> state counter
        and to do frame name-ID conversion only if the counter has
        changed.

    SPICELIB Version 5.2.1, 03-JUN-2010 (BVS)

        Header update: description of the tolerance and $Particulars
        section were expanded to address some problems arising from
        using a non-zero tolerance.

    SPICELIB Version 5.2.0, 25-AUG-2005 (NJB)

        Updated to remove non-standard use of duplicate arguments
        in <a href="mtxv.html">MTXV</a>, <a href="mxm.html">MXM</a> and <a href="vadd.html">VADD</a> calls.

    SPICELIB Version 5.1.2, 29-JAN-2004 (NJB)

        Header update: descriptions of input arguments REF and
        AV were expanded.

    SPICELIB Version 5.1.1, 27-JUL-2003 (CHA) (NJB)

        Various header corrections were made.

    SPICELIB Version 5.1.0, 23-FEB-1999 (WLT)

        The previous editions of this routine did not properly handle
        the case when TOL was negative. The routine now returns a
        value of .FALSE. for FOUND as is advertised above.

    SPICELIB Version 5.0.0, 28-JUL-1997 (WLT)

        The previous routine incorrectly computed the angular
        velocity of the transformation from the request frame
        to the platform frame of the C-matrix for non-inertial
        reference frames.

    SPICELIB Version 4.1.0, 20-DEC-1995 (WLT)

        A call to <a href="frinfo.html">FRINFO</a> did not have enough arguments and
        went undetected until Howard Taylor of ACT. Many
        thanks go out to Howard for tracking down this error.

    SPICELIB Version 4.0.0, 19-SEP-1995 (WLT)

        The routine was upgraded so that the reference frame may
        be non-inertial.

    SPICELIB Version 3.0.0, 05-OCT-1994 (WLT)

        The previous versions all computed an incorrect
        value for the angular velocity if the frame specified by
        REF was different from the reference frame of the segment
        from which the angular velocity was extracted. This has
        now been corrected.

    SPICELIB Version 2.0.1, 10-MAR-1992 (WLT)

        Comment section for permuted index source lines was added
        following the header.

    SPICELIB Version 2.0.0, 30-AUG-1991 (JML)

        1) The $Particulars section was updated to show how the
           search algorithm processes segments with continuous
           pointing data.

        2) It was specified that the angular velocity vector
           gives the right-handed axis about which the instrument
           frame rotates.

        3) The example program now loads an SCLK kernel.

        4) <a href="failed.html">FAILED</a> is checked after the call to <a href="irfrot.html">IRFROT</a> to handle the
           case where the reference frame is invalid and the error
           handling is not set to abort.

        5) <a href="failed.html">FAILED</a> is checked in the DO WHILE loop to handle the case
           where an error is detected by a SPICELIB routine inside the
           loop and the error handling is not set to abort.

    SPICELIB Version 1.1.0, 02-NOV-1990 (JML)

        1) The variable NEEDAV is no longer being saved.
        2) In the example program, the calling sequences
           for <a href="scencd.html">SCENCD</a> and <b>CKGPAV</b> were corrected.
        3) The restriction that a C-kernel file must be loaded
           was explicitly stated.

    SPICELIB Version 1.0.0, 07-SEP-1990 (RET) (IMU)</PRE>
