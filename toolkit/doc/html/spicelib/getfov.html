     INSTID   is the NAIF ID of an instrument.

     ROOM     is the maximum number of 3-dimensional vectors that can
              be returned in BOUNDS.
</PRE>
<h4><a name="Detailed_Output">Detailed_Output</a></h4>
<PRE>
     SHAPE    is a character string that describes the &quot;shape&quot; of
              the field of view. Possible values returned are:

                 'POLYGON'
                 'RECTANGLE'
                 'CIRCLE'
                 'ELLIPSE'

              If the value of SHAPE is 'POLYGON' the field of view
              of the instrument is a pyramidal polyhedron. The
              vertex of the pyramid is at the instrument focal
              point. The rays along the edges of the pyramid are
              parallel to the vectors returned in BOUNDS.

              If the value of SHAPE is 'RECTANGLE' the field of view
              of the instrument is a rectangular pyramid. The vertex
              of the pyramid is at the instrument focal point. The
              rays along the edges of the pyramid are parallel to
              the vectors returned in BOUNDS. Moreover, in this
              case, the boresight points along the axis of symmetry
              of the rectangular pyramid.

              If the value of SHAPE is 'CIRCLE' the field of view of
              the instrument is a circular cone centered on the
              boresight vector. The vertex of the cone is at the
              instrument focal point. A single vector will be
              returned in BOUNDS. This vector will be parallel to a
              ray that lies in the cone that makes up the boundary
              of the field of view.

              If the value of SHAPE is 'ELLIPSE' the field of view
              of the instrument is an elliptical cone with the
              boresight vector as the axis of the cone. In this
              case two vectors are returned in BOUNDS. One of the
              vectors returned in BOUNDS points to the end of the
              semi-major axis of a perpendicular cross section of
              the elliptic cone. The other vector points to the end
              of the semi-minor axis of a perpendicular cross
              section of the cone.

     FRAME    is the name of the reference frame in which the field
              of view boundary vectors are defined.

     BSIGHT   is a vector representing the principal instrument view
              direction that can be

                 -  the central pixel view direction,
                 -  the optical axis direction,
                 -  the FOV geometric center view direction,
                 -  an axis of the FOV frame,

              or any other vector specified for this purpose
              in the IK FOV definition. The length of BSIGHT
              is not specified other than being non-zero.

     N        is the number of boundary vectors returned.

     BOUNDS   is an array of vectors that point to the &quot;corners&quot; of
              the instrument field of view. (See the discussion
              accompanying SHAPE for an expansion of the term
              &quot;corner of the field of view.&quot;) Note that the vectors
              returned in BOUNDS are not necessarily unit vectors.
              Their magnitudes will be as set in the IK (for
              'CORNERS'-style FOV specifications) or the same as the
              magnitude of the boresight (for 'ANGLES'-style FOV
              specifications.)

     MINCOS   is the lower limit on the value of the cosine of the

     1)  If the frame associated with the instrument can not be found,
         the error SPICE(FRAMEMISSING) is signaled.

     2)  If the shape of the instrument field of view can not be found
         in the kernel pool, the error SPICE(SHAPEMISSING) is signaled
         signaled.

     3)  If the FOV_SHAPE specified by the instrument kernel is not
         one of the four values: 'CIRCLE', 'POLYGON', 'ELLIPSE', or
         'RECTANGLE', the error SPICE(SHAPENOTSUPPORTED) is signaled.
         If the 'ANGLES' specification is used, FOV_SHAPE must be
         one of the three values: 'CIRCLE', 'ELLIPSE', or 'RECTANGLE'.

     4)  If the direction of the boresight cannot be located in the
         kernel pool, the error SPICE(BORESIGHTMISSING) is signaled.

     5)  If the number of components for the boresight vector in the
         kernel pool is not 3, or they are not numeric, the error
         SPICE(BADBORESIGHTSPEC) is signaled.

     6)  If the boresight vector is the zero vector, the error 
         SPICE(ZEROBORESIGHT) is signaled.

     7)  If the 'ANGLES' specification is not present in the kernel
         pool and the boundary vectors for the edge of the field of
         view cannot be found in the kernel pool, the error
         SPICE(BOUNDARYMISSING) is signaled.

     8)  If there is insufficient room (as specified by the argument
         ROOM) to return all of the vectors associated with the
         boundary of the field of view, the error
         SPICE(BOUNDARYTOOBIG) is signaled.

     9)  If the number of components of vectors making up the field of
         view is not a multiple of 3, the error SPICE(BADBOUNDARY) is
         signaled.

     10) If the number of components of vectors making up the field of
         view is not compatible with the shape specified for the field
         of view, the error SPICE(BADBOUNDARY) is signaled.

     11) If the reference vector for the 'ANGLES' specification can not
         be found in the kernel pool, the error SPICE(REFVECTORMISSING)
         is signaled.

     12) If the reference vector stored in the kernel pool to support
         the 'ANGLES' specification contains an incorrect number of
         components, contains 3 character components, or is parallel to
         the boresight, the error SPICE(BADREFVECTORSPEC) is signaled.

     13) If the 'ANGLES' specification is present in the kernel pool
         and the reference angle stored in the kernel pool to support
         the 'ANGLES' specification is absent from the kernel pool, the
         error SPICE(REFANGLEMISSING) is signaled.

     14) If the keyword that stores the angular units for the angles
         used in the 'ANGLES' specification is absent from the kernel
         pool, the error SPICE(UNITSMISSING) is signaled.

     15) If the value used for the units in the 'ANGLES' specification
         is not one of the supported angular units of <a href="convrt.html">CONVRT</a>, an error
         is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

     16) If the keyword that stores the cross angle for the 'ANGLES'
         specification is needed and is absent from the kernel pool,
         the error SPICE(CROSSANGLEMISSING) is signaled.

     17) If the angles for the 'RECTANGLE'/'ANGLES' specification case
         have cosines that are less than those stored in the parameter
         MINCOS, the error SPICE(BADBOUNDARY) is signaled.

     18) If the class specification contains something other than
         'ANGLES' or 'CORNERS', the error SPICE(UNSUPPORTEDSPEC) is
         signaled.

     19) In the event that the CLASS_SPEC keyword is absent from the
         kernel pool for the instrument whose FOV is sought, this
         module assumes the 'CORNERS' specification is to be utilized.

     This routine relies upon having successfully loaded an instrument
     kernel (IK file) via the routine <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a> prior to calling this
     routine.

<h4><a name="Particulars">Particulars</a></h4>

     This routine provides a common interface for retrieving from the
     kernel pool the geometric characteristics of an instrument field
     of view for a wide variety of remote sensing instruments
     across many different space missions.

     Given the NAIF instrument ID, (and having &quot;loaded&quot; the
     instrument field of view description via the routine <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>)
     this routine returns the boresight of the instrument, the
     &quot;shape&quot; of the field of view, a collection of vectors
     that point along the edges of the field of view, and the
     name of the reference frame in which these vectors are defined.

     Currently this routine supports two classes of specifications
     for FOV definitions: &quot;corners&quot; and &quot;angles&quot;.

     The &quot;corners&quot; specification requires that the following keywords
     defining the shape, boresight, boundary vectors, and reference
     frame of the FOV be provided in one of the text kernel files
     (normally an IK file) loaded into the kernel pool (in the
     keywords below &lt;INSTID&gt; is replaced with the instrument ID as
     passed into the module):

        INS&lt;INSTID&gt;_FOV_CLASS_SPEC         must be set to 'CORNERS' or
                                           omitted to indicate the
                                           &quot;corners&quot;-class
                                           specification.

        INS&lt;INSTID&gt;_FOV_SHAPE              must be set to one of these
                                           values:

                                              'CIRCLE'
                                              'ELLIPSE'
                                              'RECTANGLE'
                                              'POLYGON'

        INS&lt;INSTID&gt;_FOV_FRAME              must contain the name of
                                           the frame in which the
                                           boresight and boundary
                                           corner vectors are defined.

        INS&lt;INSTID&gt;_BORESIGHT              must be set to a 3D vector
                                           defining the boresight in
                                           the FOV frame specified in
                                           the FOV_FRAME keyword.

        INS&lt;INSTID&gt;_FOV_BOUNDARY   or
        INS&lt;INSTID&gt;_FOV_BOUNDARY_CORNERS   must be set to one (for
                                           FOV_SHAPE = 'CIRCLE'), two
                                           (for FOV_SHAPE =
                                           'ELLIPSE'), four (for
                                           FOV_SHAPE = 'RECTANGLE'),
                                           or three or more (for
                                           'POLYGON') 3D vectors
                                           defining the corners of the
                                           FOV in the FOV frame
                                           specified in the FOV_FRAME
                                           keyword. The vectors should
                                           be listed in either
                                           clockwise or
                                           counterclockwise order.
                                           This is required by some
                                           SPICE routines that make
                                           use of FOV specifications.

     The &quot;angles&quot; specification requires the following keywords
     defining the shape, boresight, reference vector, reference and
     cross angular extents of the FOV be provided in one of the text
     kernel files (normally an IK file) loaded into the kernel
     pool (in the keywords below &lt;INSTID&gt; is replaced with the
     instrument ID as passed into the module):

        INS&lt;INSTID&gt;_FOV_CLASS_SPEC         must be set to 'ANGLES' to
                                           indicate the &quot;angles&quot;-class
                                           specification.

        INS&lt;INSTID&gt;_FOV_SHAPE              must be set to one of these
                                           values:

     The INS&lt;INSTID&gt;_FOV_REF_ANGLE and INS&lt;INSTID&gt;_FOV_CROSS_ANGLE
     keywords can have any values for the 'CIRCLE' and 'ELLIPSE'
     FOV shapes but must satisfy the condition COS( ANGLE ) &gt; 0 for
     the 'RECTANGLE' shape.

     This routine is intended to be an intermediate level routine.
     It is expected that users of this routine will be familiar
     with the SPICE frames subsystem and will be comfortable writing
     software to further manipulate the vectors retrieved by this
     routine.

    SPICELIB Version 2.3.0, 17-DEC-2021 (JDR) (ML) (BVS)

        Bug fix: added missing exception for the boresight vector
        being the zero vector.

        Updated long error message for 'BADBOUNDARY' exception to
        correctly describe the check that's actually done.

        Edited the header to comply with NAIF standard. Removed
        unnecessary $Revisions section.

        Updated entry #5 and added entries #14 and #18 to $Exceptions
        section. Updated $Restrictions section.

        Updated $Particulars to describe the actual condition that
        reference and cross angles values must satisfy.

        Updated to check <a href="failed.html">FAILED</a>() after calls to <a href="convrt.html">CONVRT</a> to prevent
        use of uninitialized values in subsequent calls.

    SPICELIB Version 2.2.0, 22-MAR-2017 (JDR) (BVS)

        Header updates: made various header changes to make it
        compliant with the SPICE standard header format; updated
        BSIGHT description; added explanation of output boundary
        vector magnitudes; made other minor header corrections.

        Updated code to remove unnecessary lines in the SPICE
        error handling IF-THEN-ELSE statements.

    SPICELIB Version 2.1.1, 05-FEB-2009 (BVS)

        Header updates: added information about required IK keywords;
        replaced old example with a new one more focused on <b>GETFOV</b> and
        IK keywords.

    SPICELIB Version 2.1.0, 23-OCT-2005 (NJB) (BVS)

        Fixed bug causing incorrect computation of the boundary
        vectors for a rectangular FOV specified using the angular
        extents method if the reference vector was provided as a
        non-unit vector and/or was non-perpendicular to the
        specified boresight.

        Updated to remove non-standard use of duplicate arguments
        in <a href="convrt.html">CONVRT</a>, <a href="unorm.html">UNORM</a>, <a href="vhat.html">VHAT</a>, <a href="vscl.html">VSCL</a> and VCROSS calls.

        Replaced header reference to <a href="ldpool.html">LDPOOL</a> with reference to <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

    SPICELIB Version 2.0.1, 29-JUL-2003 (NJB) (CHA)

        Various header changes were made to improve clarity. Some
        minor header corrections were made.

    SPICELIB Version 2.0.0, 15-MAY-2001 (FST)

        Updated the routine to support the new ANGLES specification
        for RECTANGLE, ELLIPSE, and CIRCLE.

    SPICELIB Version 1.1.2, 10-MAY-2000 (WLT)

        Removed the unused variable INDEX.

    SPICELIB Version 1.1.1, 13-APR-2000 (WLT)

        This routine was harvested from the NEAR specific routine
        of the same name. It was enhanced to support the 'RECTANGLE'
        shape for a field of view (a special case of 'POLYGON'
        added for the sake of Cassini users).</PRE>
