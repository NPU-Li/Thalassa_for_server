     TARG     is the NAIF ID code for a target body. The target
              and observer define a state vector whose position
              component points from the observer to the target.

     ET       is the ephemeris time, expressed as seconds past
              J2000 TDB, at which the state of the target body
              relative to the observer is to be computed.  ET
              refers to time at the observer's location.

     REF      is the inertial reference frame with respect to which
              the input state STOBS, the input acceleration ACCOBS,
              and the output state STARG are expressed. REF must be
              recognized by the SPICE Toolkit. The acceptable
              frames are listed in the Frames Required Reading, as
              well as in the SPICELIB routine <a href="chgirf.html">CHGIRF</a>.

              Case and blanks are not significant in the string
              REF.

     ABCORR   indicates the aberration corrections to be applied
              to the state of the target body to account for one-way
              light time and stellar aberration. See the discussion
              in the header of <a href="spkezr.html">SPKEZR</a> for recommendations on
              how to choose aberration corrections.

              ABCORR may be any of the following:

                 'NONE'     Apply no correction. Return the
                            geometric state of the target body
                            relative to the observer.

              The following values of ABCORR apply to the
              &quot;reception&quot; case in which photons depart from the
              target's location at the light-time corrected epoch
              ET-LT and *arrive* at the observer's location at ET:

                 'LT'       Correct for one-way light time (also
                            called &quot;planetary aberration&quot;) using a
                            Newtonian formulation. This correction
                            yields the state of the target at the
                            moment it emitted photons arriving at
                            the observer at ET.

                            The light time correction uses an
                            iterative solution of the light time
                            equation (see $Particulars for details).
                            The solution invoked by the 'LT' option
                            uses one iteration.

                 'LT+S'     Correct for one-way light time and
                            stellar aberration using a Newtonian
                            formulation. This option modifies the
                            state obtained with the 'LT' option to
                            account for the observer's velocity
                            relative to the solar system
                            barycenter. The result is the apparent
                            state of the target---the position and
                            velocity of the target as seen by the
                            observer.

                 'CN'       Converged Newtonian light time
                            correction. In solving the light time
                            equation, the 'CN' correction iterates
                            until the solution converges (three
                            iterations on all supported platforms).
                            Whether the 'CN+S' solution is
                            substantially more accurate than the
                            'LT' solution depends on the geometry
                            of the participating objects and on the
                            accuracy of the input data. In all
                            cases this routine will execute more
                            slowly when a converged solution is
                            computed. See the $Particulars section of
                            <a href="spkezr.html">SPKEZR</a> for a discussion of precision of
                            light time corrections.

                 'CN+S'     Converged Newtonian light time
                            correction and stellar aberration
                            correction.

              The following values of ABCORR apply to the
              &quot;transmission&quot; case in which photons *depart* from
              the observer's location at ET and arrive at the
              target's location at the light-time corrected epoch
              ET+LT:

                 'XLT'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                            one-way light time using a Newtonian
                            formulation. This correction yields the
                            state of the target at the moment it
                            receives photons emitted from the
                            observer's location at ET.

                 'XLT+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                            one-way light time and stellar
                            aberration using a Newtonian
                            formulation  This option modifies the
                            state obtained with the 'XLT' option to
                            account for the observer's velocity
                            relative to the solar system
                            barycenter. The position component of
                            the computed target state indicates the
                            direction that photons emitted from the
                            observer's location must be &quot;aimed&quot; to
                            hit the target.

                 'XCN'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged
                            Newtonian light time correction.

                 'XCN+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged
                            Newtonian light time correction and
                            stellar aberration correction.


              Neither special nor general relativistic effects are
              accounted for in the aberration corrections applied
              by this routine.

              Case and blanks are not significant in the string
              ABCORR.


     STOBS    is the geometric state of the observer relative to
              the solar system barycenter at ET. STOBS is expressed
              relative to the reference frame designated by REF.
              The target and observer define a state vector whose
              position component points from the observer to the
              target.

     ACCOBS   is the geometric acceleration of the observer
              relative to the solar system barycenter at ET. This
              is the derivative with respect to time of the
              velocity portion of STOBS. ACCOBS is expressed
              relative to the reference frame designated by REF.

              ACCOBS is used for computing stellar aberration
              corrected velocity. If stellar aberration corrections
              are not specified by ABCORR, ACCOBS is ignored; the
              caller need not provide a valid input value in this
              case.
</PRE>
<h4><a name="Detailed_Output">Detailed_Output</a></h4>
<PRE>
     STARG    is a Cartesian state vector representing the position
              and velocity of the target body relative to the
              specified observer. STARG is corrected for the
              specified aberrations, and is expressed with respect
              to the inertial reference frame designated by REF.
              The first three components of STARG represent the x-,
              y- and z-components of the target's position; last
              three components form the corresponding velocity
              vector.

              The position component of STARG points from the
              observer's location at ET to the aberration-corrected
              location of the target. Note that the sense of the
              position vector is independent of the direction of
              radiation travel implied by the aberration
              correction.

              Units are always km and km/sec.

     LT       is the one-way light time between the observer and
              target in seconds. If the target state is corrected
              for light time, then LT is the one-way light time
              between the observer and the light time-corrected
              target location.

     DLT      is the derivative with respect to barycentric
              dynamical time of the one way light time between
              target and observer:

                 DLT = d(LT)/d(ET)

              DLT can also be described as the rate of change of
              one way light time. DLT is unitless, since LT and
              ET both have units of TDB seconds.

              If the observer and target are at the same position,
              then DLT is set to zero.

     1)  If the value of ABCORR is not recognized, an error is signaled
         by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

     2)  If ABCORR calls for stellar aberration but not light
         time corrections, the error SPICE(NOTSUPPORTED) is
         signaled.

     3)  If ABCORR calls for relativistic light time corrections, the
         error SPICE(NOTSUPPORTED) is signaled.

     4)  If the reference frame requested is not a recognized
         inertial reference frame, the error SPICE(BADFRAME)
         is signaled.

     5)  If the state of the target relative to the solar system
         barycenter cannot be computed, an error is signaled by a
         routine in the call tree of this routine.

     6)  If the observer and target are at the same position,
         then DLT is set to zero. This situation could arise,
         for example, when the observer is Mars and the target
         is the Mars barycenter.

<h4><a name="Files">Files</a></h4>
<PRE>
     This routine computes states using SPK files that have been
     loaded into the SPICE system, normally via the kernel loading
     interface routine <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>. Application programs typically load
     kernels once before this routine is called, for example during
     program initialization; kernels need not be loaded repeatedly.
     See the routine <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a> and the SPK and KERNEL Required Reading
     for further information on loading (and unloading) kernels.

     If any of the ephemeris data used to compute STARG are expressed
     relative to a non-inertial frame in the SPK files providing those
     data, additional kernels may be needed to enable the reference
     frame transformations required to compute the state. Normally
     these additional kernels are PCK files or frame kernels. Any such
     kernels must already be loaded at the time this routine is
     called.

     This routine supports higher-level SPK API routines that can
     perform both light time and stellar aberration corrections.

     User applications normally will not need to call this routine
     directly. However, this routine can improve run-time efficiency
     in situations where many targets are observed from the same
     location at the same time. In such cases, the state and
     acceleration of the observer relative to the solar system
     barycenter need be computed only once per look-up epoch.

     When apparent positions, rather than apparent states, are
     required, consider using the high-level position-only API
     routines

        <a href="spkpos.html">SPKPOS</a>
        <a href="spkezp.html">SPKEZP</a>

     or the low-level, position-only analog of this routine

        <a href="spkapo.html">SPKAPO</a>

     In general, the position-only routines are more efficient.

     See the header of the routine <a href="spkezr.html">SPKEZR</a> for a detailed discussion
     of aberration corrections.

     The numerical results shown for this example may differ across
     platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as
     input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine
     specific arithmetic implementation.

     1) Look up a sequence of states of the Moon as seen from the
        Earth. Use light time and stellar aberration corrections.
        Compute the first state for the epoch 2000 JAN 1 12:00:00 TDB;
        compute subsequent states at intervals of 1 hour. For each
        epoch, display the states, the one way light time between
        target and observer, and the rate of change of the one way
        light time.

           assumed to contain adequate or correct versions of data
           required by SPICE-based user applications.

           In order for an application to use this meta-kernel, the
           kernels referenced here must be present in the user's
           current working directory.

           The names and contents of the kernels referenced
           by this meta-kernel are as follows:

        C           Target:                 Moon (NAIF ID code 301)
        C           Reference frame:        J2000

        C        Before we can execute this computation, we'll need the

<h4><a name="Restrictions">Restrictions</a></h4>
<PRE>
     1)  This routine should not be used to compute geometric states.
         Instead, use <a href="spkezr.html">SPKEZR</a>, <a href="spkez.html">SPKEZ</a>, or <a href="spkgeo.html">SPKGEO</a>. <a href="spkgeo.html">SPKGEO</a>, which is called
         by <a href="spkezr.html">SPKEZR</a> and <a href="spkez.html">SPKEZ</a>, introduces less round-off error when the
         observer and target have a common center that is closer to
         both objects than is the solar system barycenter.

     2)  The kernel files to be used by <b>SPKAPS</b> must be loaded
         (normally by the SPICELIB kernel loader <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>) before
         this routine is called.

     3)  Unlike most other SPK state computation routines, this
         routine requires that the output state be relative to an
         inertial reference frame.

<h4><a name="Version">Version</a></h4>

    SPICELIB Version 1.2.0, 26-OCT-2021 (JDR) (NJB)

        Edited the header to comply with NAIF standard. Updated
        example's meta-kernel.

        Bug fix: ABCORR now is parsed using ZZVALCOR. This improves
        error checking. Removed unnecessary in-line error checking
        now provided by ZZVALCOR.

    SPICELIB Version 1.1.0, 04-JUL-2014 (NJB)

        Discussion of light time corrections was updated. Assertions
        that converged light time corrections are unlikely to be
        useful were removed.

     Last update was 15-APR-2014 (NJB)

        Added a <a href="failed.html">FAILED</a>() call to prevent numeric problems
        resulting from uninitialized values.
