     UDFUNS   is the routine that returns the value of the scalar
              quantity of interest at time ET. The calling sequence for
              UDFUNC is:

                 CALL UDFUNS ( ET, VALUE )

              where:

                 ET      a double precision value representing
                         ephemeris time, expressed as seconds past
                         J2000 TDB at which to evaluate UDFUNS.

                 VALUE   is the value of the scalar quantity
                         at ET.

     UDFUNB   is the user defined routine returning a boolean value for
              an epoch ET. The calling sequence for UNFUNB is:

                 CALL UDFUNB ( UDFUNS, ET, BOOL )

              where:

                 UDFUNS   the name of the scalar function as
                          defined above.

                 ET       a double precision value representing
                          ephemeris time, expressed as seconds past
                          J2000 TDB, at which to evaluate UDFUNB.

                 BOOL     the boolean value at ET.

              <b>GFUDB</b> will correctly operate only for boolean functions
              with true conditions defining non zero measure time
              intervals.

              Note, UDFUNB need not call UDFUNS. The use of UDFUNS is
              determined by the needs of the calculation and the user's
              design.

     STEP     is the step size to be used in the search. STEP must be
              shorter than any interval, within the confinement window,
              over which the user defined boolean function is met. In
              other words, STEP must be shorter than the shortest time
              interval for which the boolean function is .TRUE.; STEP
              must also be shorter than the shortest time interval
              between two boolean function true events occurring within
              the confinement window (see below). However, STEP must
              not be *too* short, or the search will take an
              unreasonable amount of time.

              The choice of STEP affects the completeness but not
              the precision of solutions found by this routine; the
              precision is controlled by the convergence tolerance.
              See the discussion of the parameter CNVTOL for
              details.

              STEP has units of TDB seconds.

     CNFINE   is a SPICE window that confines the time period over
              which the specified search is conducted. CNFINE may
              consist of a single interval or a collection of
              intervals.

              In some cases the confinement window can be used to
              greatly reduce the time period that must be searched
              for the desired solution. See the $Particulars section
              below for further discussion.

              See the $Examples section below for a code example
              that shows how to create a confinement window.

              CNFINE must be initialized by the caller via the
              SPICELIB routine <a href="ssized.html">SSIZED</a>.

              Certain computations can expand the time window over
              which UDFUNS and UDFUNB require data. See $Particulars
              for details.

     RESULT   is a double precision SPICE window which will contain
              the search results. RESULT must be declared and
              initialized with sufficient size to capture the full
              set of time intervals within the search region on which
              the specified condition is satisfied.

              RESULT must be initialized by the caller via the
              SPICELIB routine <a href="ssized.html">SSIZED</a>.

              If RESULT is non-empty on input, its contents will be
              discarded before <b>GFUDB</b> conducts its search.
</PRE>
<h4><a name="Detailed_Output">Detailed_Output</a></h4>

     RESULT   is a SPICE window containing the time intervals within
              the confinement window, during which the specified
              boolean quantity is .TRUE.

              The endpoints of the time intervals comprising RESULT are
              interpreted as seconds past J2000 TDB.

              If no times within the confinement window satisfy the
              search criteria, RESULT will be returned with a
              cardinality of zero.

     LBCELL   is the integer value defining the lower bound for
              SPICE Cell arrays (a SPICE window is a kind of cell).

     CNVTOL   is the convergence tolerance used for finding
              endpoints of the intervals comprising the result
              window. CNVTOL is used to determine when binary
              searches for roots should terminate: when a root is
              bracketed within an interval of length CNVTOL, the
              root is considered to have been found.

              The accuracy, as opposed to precision, of roots found
              by this routine depends on the accuracy of the input
              data. In most cases, the accuracy of solutions will be
              inferior to their precision.

     See INCLUDE file gf.inc for declarations and descriptions of
     parameters used throughout the GF system.

     1)  In order for this routine to produce correct results,
         the step size must be appropriate for the problem at hand.
         Step sizes that are too large may cause this routine to miss
         roots; step sizes that are too small may cause this routine
         to run unacceptably slowly and in some cases, find spurious
         roots.

         This routine does not diagnose invalid step sizes, except that
         if the step size is non-positive, an error is signaled by a
         routine in the call tree of this routine.

     2)  Due to numerical errors, in particular,

            - truncation error in time values
            - finite tolerance value
            - errors in computed geometric quantities

         it is *normal* for the condition of interest to not always be
         satisfied near the endpoints of the intervals comprising the
         RESULT window. One technique to handle such a situation,
         slightly contract RESULT using the window routine <a href="wncond.html">WNCOND</a>.

     3)  If an error (typically cell overflow) occurs while performing
         window arithmetic, the error is signaled by a routine
         in the call tree of this routine.

     4)  If the size of the SPICE window RESULT is less than 2 or not
         an even value, the error SPICE(INVALIDDIMENSION) is signaled.

     5)  If RESULT has insufficient capacity to contain the number of
         intervals on which the specified condition is met, an error is
         signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

     6)  If required ephemerides or other kernel data are not
         available, an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree
         of this routine.

     Appropriate kernels must be loaded by the calling program before
     this routine is called.

     If the boolean function requires access to ephemeris data:

     -  SPK data: ephemeris data for any body over the
        time period defined by the confinement window must be
        loaded. If aberration corrections are used, the states of
        target and observer relative to the solar system barycenter
        must be calculable from the available ephemeris data.
        Typically ephemeris data are made available by loading one
        or more SPK files via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

     -  If non-inertial reference frames are used, then PCK
        files, frame kernels, C-kernels, and SCLK kernels may be
        needed.

     -  Certain computations can expand the time window over which
        UDFUNS and UDFUNB require data; such data must be provided by
        loaded kernels. See $Particulars for details.

     In all cases, kernel data are normally loaded once per program
     run, NOT every time this routine is called.

<h4><a name="Particulars">Particulars</a></h4>
<PRE>
     This routine determines a set of one or more time intervals
     within the confinement window when the boolean function
     evaluates to true. The resulting set of intervals is returned
     as a SPICE window.

     Below we discuss in greater detail aspects of this routine's
     solution process that are relevant to correct and efficient
     use of this routine in user applications.

     UDFUNS Default Template
     =======================

     The boolean function includes an argument for an input scalar
     function. Use of a scalar function during the evaluation of
     the boolean function is not required. SPICE provides a no-op
     scalar routine, <a href="udf.html">UDF</a>, as a dummy argument for instances when
     the boolean function does not need to call the scalar function.

     The Search Process
     ==================

     The search for boolean events is treated as a search for state
     transitions: times are sought when the boolean function value
     changes from true to false or vice versa.

     Step Size
     =========

     Each interval of the confinement window is searched as follows:
     first, the input step size is used to determine the time
     separation at which the boolean function will be sampled.
     Starting at the left endpoint of the interval, samples of the
     boolean function will be taken at each step. If a state change
     is detected, a root has been bracketed; at that point, the
     &quot;root&quot;--the time at which the state change occurs---is found by a
     refinement process, for example, via binary search.

     Note that the optimal choice of step size depends on the lengths
     of the intervals over which the boolean function is constant:
     the step size should be shorter than the shortest such interval
     and the shortest separation between the intervals, within
     the confinement window.

     Having some knowledge of the relative geometry of the targets and
     observer can be a valuable aid in picking a reasonable step size.
     In general, the user can compensate for lack of such knowledge by
     picking a very short step size; the cost is increased computation
     time.

     Note that the step size is not related to the precision with which
     the endpoints of the intervals of the result window are computed.
     That precision level is controlled by the convergence tolerance.


     Convergence Tolerance
     =====================

     Once a root has been bracketed, a refinement process is used to
     narrow down the time interval within which the root must lie.
     This refinement process terminates when the location of the root
     has been determined to within an error margin called the
     &quot;convergence tolerance.&quot; The default convergence tolerance
     used by this routine is set by the parameter CNVTOL (defined
     in gf.inc).

     The value of CNVTOL is set to a &quot;tight&quot; value so that the
     tolerance doesn't become the limiting factor in the accuracy of
     solutions found by this routine. In general the accuracy of input
     data will be the limiting factor.

     The user may change the convergence tolerance from the default
     CNVTOL value by calling the routine <a href="gfstol.html">GFSTOL</a>, e.g.

        CALL <a href="gfstol.html">GFSTOL</a>( tolerance value )

     Call <a href="gfstol.html">GFSTOL</a> prior to calling this routine. All subsequent
     searches will use the updated tolerance value.

     Setting the tolerance tighter than CNVTOL is unlikely to be
     useful, since the results are unlikely to be more accurate.
     Making the tolerance looser will speed up searches somewhat,
     since a few convergence steps will be omitted. However, in most
     cases, the step size is likely to have a much greater effect
     on processing time than would the convergence tolerance.


     The Confinement Window
     ======================

     The simplest use of the confinement window is to specify a time
     interval within which a solution is sought.

     The confinement window also can be used to restrict a search to
     a time window over which required data are known to be
     available.

     In some cases, the confinement window can be used to make
     searches more efficient. Sometimes it's possible to do an
     efficient search to reduce the size of the time period over
     which a relatively slow search of interest must be performed.
     See the &quot;CASCADE&quot; example program in gf.req for a demonstration.

     Certain user-defined computations may expand the window over
     which computations are performed. Here &quot;expansion&quot; of a window by
     an amount &quot;T&quot; means that the left endpoint of each interval
     comprising the window is shifted left by T, the right endpoint of
     each interval is shifted right by T, and any overlapping
     intervals are merged. Note that the input window CNFINE itself is
     not modified.

     Computation of observer-target states by <a href="spkezr.html">SPKEZR</a> or <a href="spkez.html">SPKEZ</a>, using
     stellar aberration corrections, requires the state of the
     observer, relative to the solar system barycenter, to be computed
     at times offset from the input time by +/- 1 second. If the input
     time ET is used by UDFUNS or UDFUNB to compute such a state, the
     window over which the observer state is computed is expanded by 1
     second.

     When light time corrections are used in the computation of
     observer-target states, expansion of the search window also
     affects the set of times at which the light time-corrected states
     of the targets are computed.

     In addition to possible expansion of the search window when
     stellar aberration corrections are used, round-off error should
     be taken into account when the need for data availability is
     analyzed.

     The numerical results shown for these examples may differ across
     platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as
     input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine
     specific arithmetic implementation.

        relative to the Earth in the IAU_EARTH frame has a positive
