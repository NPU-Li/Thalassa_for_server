     TARGET   is the name of a target body. Optionally, you may supply
              the integer ID code for the object as an integer string.
              For example both 'MOON' and '301' are legitimate strings
              that indicate the moon is the target body.

              The target and observer define a position vector that
              points from the observer to the target. The derivative
              with respect to time of the length of this vector is the
              &quot;range rate&quot; used by this routine as the geometric
              quantity of interest.

              Case and leading or trailing blanks are not significant
              in the string TARGET.

     ABCORR   is the description of the aberration corrections to apply
              to the state evaluations to account for one-way light
              time and stellar aberration.

              This routine accepts the same aberration corrections as
              does the SPICE routine <a href="spkezr.html">SPKEZR</a>. See the header of <a href="spkezr.html">SPKEZR</a>
              for a detailed description of the aberration correction
              options. For convenience, the options are listed below:

                 'NONE'     Apply no correction. Returns the &quot;true&quot;
                            geometric state.

                 'LT'       &quot;Reception&quot; case: correct for
                            one-way light time using a Newtonian
                            formulation.

                 'LT+S'     &quot;Reception&quot; case: correct for
                            one-way light time and stellar
                            aberration using a Newtonian
                            formulation.

                 'CN'       &quot;Reception&quot; case: converged
                            Newtonian light time correction.

                 'CN+S'     &quot;Reception&quot; case: converged
                            Newtonian light time and stellar
                            aberration corrections.

                 'XLT'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                            one-way light time using a Newtonian
                            formulation.

                 'XLT+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                            one-way light time and stellar
                            aberration using a Newtonian
                            formulation.

                 'XCN'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged
                            Newtonian light time correction.

                 'XCN+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged
                            Newtonian light time and stellar
                            aberration corrections.

              Case and leading or trailing blanks are not significant
              in the string ABCORR.

     OBSRVR   is the name of an observing body. Optionally, you may
              supply the ID code of the object as an integer string.
              For example, both 'EARTH' and '399' are legitimate
              strings to indicate that the observer is the Earth.

              Case and leading or trailing blanks are not significant
              in the string OBSRVR.

     RELATE   is the relational operator that defines the constraint on
              the range rate of the observer-target vector. The result
              window found by this routine indicates the time intervals
              where the constraint is satisfied. Supported values of
              RELATE and corresponding meanings are shown below:

                 '&gt;'        The range rate value is greater than the
                            reference value REFVAL.

                 '='        The range rate value is equal to the
                            reference value REFVAL.

                 '&lt;'        The range rate value is less than the
                            reference value REFVAL.

                 'ABSMAX'   The range rate value is at an absolute
                            maximum.

                 'ABSMIN'   The range rate value is at an absolute
                            minimum.

                 'LOCMAX'   The range rate value is at a local
                            maximum.

                 'LOCMIN'   The range rate value is at a local
                            minimum.

              RELATE may be used to specify an &quot;adjusted&quot; absolute
              extremum constraint: this requires the range rate to be
              within a specified offset relative to an absolute
              extremum. The argument ADJUST (described below) is used
              to specify this offset.

              Local extrema are considered to exist only in the
              interiors of the intervals comprising the confinement
              window:  a local extremum cannot exist at a boundary
              point of the confinement window.

              Case and leading or trailing blanks are not
              significant in the string RELATE.

     REFVAL   is the double precision reference value used together
              with the argument RELATE to define an equality or
              inequality to satisfy by the range rate of the
              observer-target vector. See the discussion of RELATE
              above for further information.

              The units of REFVAL are km/s.

     ADJUST   is a double precision value used to modify searches for
              absolute extrema: when RELATE is set to 'ABSMAX' or
              'ABSMIN' and ADJUST is set to a positive value, <b>GFRR</b>
              finds times when the range rate is within ADJUST
              kilometers/second of the specified extreme value.

              For RELATE set to 'ABSMAX', the RESULT window contains
              time intervals when the range rate has
              values between ABSMAX - ADJUST and ABSMAX.

              For RELATE set to 'ABSMIN', the RESULT window contains
              time intervals when the range rate has
              values between ABSMIN and ABSMIN + ADJUST.

              ADJUST is not used for searches for local extrema,
              equality or inequality conditions.

     STEP     is the double precision time step size to use in the
              search.

              STEP must be short enough for a search using this step
              size to locate the time intervals where the range rate
              function is monotone increasing or decreasing. However,
              STEP must not be *too* short, or the search will take an
              unreasonable amount of time.

              The choice of STEP affects the completeness but not
              the precision of solutions found by this routine; the
              precision is controlled by the convergence tolerance.
              See the discussion of the parameter CNVTOL for
              details.

              STEP has units of TDB seconds.

     CNFINE   is a double precision SPICE window that confines the time
              period over which the specified search is conducted.
              CNFINE may consist of a single interval or a collection
              of intervals.

              In some cases the confinement window can be used to
              greatly reduce the time period that must be searched
              for the desired solution. See the $Particulars section
              below for further discussion.

              See the $Examples section below for a code example
              that shows how to create a confinement window.

              CNFINE must be initialized by the caller using the
              SPICELIB routine <a href="ssized.html">SSIZED</a>.

              In some cases the observer's state may be computed at
              times outside of CNFINE by as much as 2 seconds. See
              $Particulars for details.

     MW       is a parameter specifying the length of the SPICE
              windows in the workspace array WORK (see description
              below) used by this routine.

              MW should be set to a number at least twice as large
              as the maximum number of intervals required by any
              workspace window. In many cases, it's not necessary to
              compute an accurate estimate of how many intervals are
              needed; rather, the user can pick a size considerably
              larger than what's really required.

              However, since excessively large arrays can prevent
              applications from compiling, linking, or running
              properly, sometimes MW must be set according to
              the actual workspace requirement. A rule of thumb
              for the number of intervals NINTVLS needed is

                  NINTVLS  =  2*N  +  ( M / STEP )

              where

                  N     is the number of intervals in the confinement
                        window

                  M     is the measure of the confinement window, in
                        units of seconds

                  STEP  is the search step size in seconds

              MW should then be set to

                  2 * NINTVLS

     NW       is a parameter specifying the number of SPICE windows
              in the workspace array WORK (see description below)
              used by this routine. NW should be set to the
              parameter NWRR; this parameter is declared in the
              include file gf.inc. (The reason this dimension is
              an input argument is that this allows run-time
              error checking to be performed.)

     RESULT   is a double precision SPICE window which will contain
              the search results. RESULT must be declared and
              initialized with sufficient size to capture the full
              set of time intervals within the search region on which
              the specified condition is satisfied.

              RESULT must be initialized by the caller via the
              SPICELIB routine <a href="ssized.html">SSIZED</a>.

              If RESULT is non-empty on input, its contents will be
              discarded before <b>GFRR</b> conducts its search.
</PRE>
<h4><a name="Detailed_Output">Detailed_Output</a></h4>
<PRE>
     WORK     is an array used to store workspace windows.

              This array should be declared by the caller as shown:

                 INCLUDE 'gf.inc'
                    ...

                 DOUBLE PRECISION    WORK ( LBCELL : MW, NWRR )

              where MW is a constant declared by the caller and NWRR is
              a constant defined in the SPICELIB INCLUDE file gf.inc.
              See the discussion of MW above.

              WORK need not be initialized by the caller.

              WORK is modified by this routine. The caller should
              re-initialize this array before attempting to use it for
              any other purpose.

     RESULT   is the SPICE window of intervals, contained within the
              confinement window CNFINE, on which the specified
              constraint is satisfied.

              The endpoints of the time intervals comprising RESULT are
              interpreted as seconds past J2000 TDB.

              If the search is for local extrema, or for absolute
              extrema with ADJUST set to zero, then normally each
              interval of RESULT will be a singleton: the left and
              right endpoints of each interval will be identical.

              If no times within the confinement window satisfy the
              search criteria, RESULT will be returned with a
              cardinality of zero.

     LBCELL   is the integer value defining the lower bound for
              SPICE Cell arrays (a SPICE window is a kind of cell).

     CNVTOL   is the convergence tolerance used for finding
              endpoints of the intervals comprising the result
              window. CNVTOL is also used for finding intermediate
              results; in particular, CNVTOL is used for finding the
              windows on which the range rate is increasing
              or decreasing. CNVTOL is used to determine when binary
              searches for roots should terminate: when a root is
              bracketed within an interval of length CNVTOL; the
              root is considered to have been found.

              The accuracy, as opposed to precision, of roots found
              by this routine depends on the accuracy of the input
              data. In most cases, the accuracy of solutions will be
              inferior to their precision.

     1)  In order for this routine to produce correct results,
         the step size must be appropriate for the problem at hand.
         Step sizes that are too large may cause this routine to miss
         roots; step sizes that are too small may cause this routine
         to run unacceptably slowly and in some cases, find spurious
         roots.

         This routine does not diagnose invalid step sizes, except that
         if the step size is non-positive, an error is signaled by a
         routine in the call tree of this routine.

     2)  Due to numerical errors, in particular,

            - truncation error in time values
            - finite tolerance value
            - errors in computed geometric quantities

         it is *normal* for the condition of interest to not always be
         satisfied near the endpoints of the intervals comprising the
         RESULT window. One technique to handle such a situation,
         slightly contract RESULT using the window routine <a href="wncond.html">WNCOND</a>.

     3)  If the workspace window size MW is less than 2 or not an even
         value, the error SPICE(INVALIDDIMENSION) is signaled.

     4)  If the size of the workspace WORK is too small, an error is
         signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

     5)  If the size of the SPICE window RESULT is less than 2 or not
         an even value, the error SPICE(INVALIDDIMENSION) is signaled.

     6)  If the SPICE window RESULT has insufficient capacity to
         contain the number of intervals on which the specified
         distance condition is met, an error is signaled by a routine
         in the call tree of this routine.

     7)  If the window count NW is less than NWRR, the error
         SPICE(INVALIDDIMENSION) is signaled.

     8)  If an error (typically cell overflow) occurs during
         window arithmetic, the error is signaled by a routine
         in the call tree of this routine.

     9)  If the relational operator RELATE is not recognized, an
         error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this
         routine.

     10) If the aberration correction specifier contains an
         unrecognized value, an error is signaled by a routine in the
         call tree of this routine.

     11) If ADJUST is negative, an error is signaled by a routine in
         the call tree of this routine.

     12) If ADJUST has a non-zero value when RELATE has any value other
         than 'ABSMIN' or 'ABSMAX', an error is signaled by a routine
         in the call tree of this routine.

     13) If either of the input body names do not map to NAIF ID
         codes, an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of
         this routine.

     14) If required ephemerides or other kernel data are not
         available, an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree
         of this routine.

     Appropriate SPK and PCK kernels must be loaded by the calling
     program before this routine is called.

     The following data are required:

     -  SPK data: the calling application must load ephemeris data
        for the targets, observer, and any intermediate objects in
        a chain connecting the targets and observer that cover the
        time period specified by the window CNFINE. If aberration
        corrections are used, the states of target and observer
        relative to the solar system barycenter must be calculable
        from the available ephemeris data. Typically ephemeris data
        are made available by loading one or more SPK files using
        <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

     -  In some cases the observer's state may be computed at times
        outside of CNFINE by as much as 2 seconds; data required to
        compute this state must be provided by loaded kernels. See
        $Particulars for details.

     Kernel data are normally loaded once per program run, NOT every
     time this routine is called.

     This routine determines if the caller-specified constraint
     condition on the geometric event (range rate) is satisfied for
     any time intervals within the confinement window CNFINE. If one
     or more such time intervals exist, those intervals are added
     to the RESULT window.

     This routine provides a simpler, but less flexible interface
     than does the routine <a href="gfevnt.html">GFEVNT</a> for conducting searches for
     observer-target range rate value events. Applications that
     require support for progress reporting, interrupt handling,
     non-default step or refinement functions, or non-default
     convergence tolerance should call <a href="gfevnt.html">GFEVNT</a> rather than this routine.

     Below we discuss in greater detail aspects of this routine's
     solution process that are relevant to correct and efficient
     use of this routine in user applications.


     The Search Process
     ==================

     Regardless of the type of constraint selected by the caller, this
     routine starts the search for solutions by determining the time
     periods, within the confinement window, over which the
     range rate function is monotone increasing and monotone
     decreasing. Each of these time periods is represented by a SPICE
     window. Having found these windows, all of the range rate
     function's local extrema within the confinement window are known.
     Absolute extrema then can be found very easily.

     Within any interval of these &quot;monotone&quot; windows, there will be at
     most one solution of any equality constraint. Since the boundary
     of the solution set for any inequality constraint is contained in
     the union of

     -  the set of points where an equality constraint is met

     -  the boundary points of the confinement window

     the solutions of both equality and inequality constraints can be
     found easily once the monotone windows have been found.


     Step Size
     =========

     The monotone windows (described above) are found using a two-step
     search process. Each interval of the confinement window is
     searched as follows: first, the input step size is used to
     determine the time separation at which the sign of the rate of
     change of range rate will be sampled. Starting at
     the left endpoint of an interval, samples will be taken at each
     step. If a change of sign is found, a root has been bracketed; at
     that point, the time at which the time derivative of the
     range rate is zero can be found by a refinement process, for
     example, using a binary search.

     Note that the optimal choice of step size depends on the lengths
     of the intervals over which the range rate function is monotone:
     the step size should be shorter than the shortest of these
     intervals (within the confinement window).

     The optimal step size is *not* necessarily related to the lengths
     of the intervals comprising the result window. For example, if
     the shortest monotone interval has length 10 days, and if the
     shortest result window interval has length 5 minutes, a step size
     of 9.9 days is still adequate to find all of the intervals in the
     result window. In situations like this, the technique of using
     monotone windows yields a dramatic efficiency improvement over a
     state-based search that simply tests at each step whether the
     specified constraint is satisfied. The latter type of search can
     miss solution intervals if the step size is longer than the
     shortest solution interval.

     Having some knowledge of the relative geometry of the target and
     observer can be a valuable aid in picking a reasonable step size.
     In general, the user can compensate for lack of such knowledge by
     picking a very short step size; the cost is increased computation
     time.

     Note that the step size is not related to the precision with which
     the endpoints of the intervals of the result window are computed.
     That precision level is controlled by the convergence tolerance.


     Convergence Tolerance
     =====================

     As described above, the root-finding process used by this routine
     involves first bracketing roots and then using a search process
     to locate them. &quot;Roots&quot; are both times when local extrema are
     attained and times when the range rate function is equal to a
     reference value. All endpoints of the intervals comprising the
     result window are either endpoints of intervals of the
     confinement window or roots.

     Once a root has been bracketed, a refinement process is used to
     narrow down the time interval within which the root must lie.
     This refinement process terminates when the location of the root
     has been determined to within an error margin called the
     &quot;convergence tolerance.&quot; The default convergence tolerance
     used by this routine is set by the parameter CNVTOL (defined
     in gf.inc).

     The value of CNVTOL is set to a &quot;tight&quot; value so that the
     tolerance doesn't become the limiting factor in the accuracy of
     solutions found by this routine. In general the accuracy of input
     data will be the limiting factor.

     The user may change the convergence tolerance from the default
     CNVTOL value by calling the routine <a href="gfstol.html">GFSTOL</a>, e.g.

        CALL <a href="gfstol.html">GFSTOL</a>( tolerance value )

     Call <a href="gfstol.html">GFSTOL</a> prior to calling this routine. All subsequent
     searches will use the updated tolerance value.

     Setting the tolerance tighter than CNVTOL is unlikely to be
     useful, since the results are unlikely to be more accurate.
     Making the tolerance looser will speed up searches somewhat,
     since a few convergence steps will be omitted. However, in most
     cases, the step size is likely to have a much greater effect
     on processing time than would the convergence tolerance.


     The Confinement Window
     ======================

     The simplest use of the confinement window is to specify a time
     interval within which a solution is sought. However, the
     confinement window can, in some cases, be used to make searches
     more efficient. Sometimes it's possible to do an efficient search
     to reduce the size of the time period over which a relatively
     slow search of interest must be performed.

     Certain types of searches require the state of the observer,
     relative to the solar system barycenter, to be computed at times
     slightly outside the confinement window CNFINE. The time window
     that is actually used is the result of &quot;expanding&quot; CNFINE by a
     specified amount &quot;T&quot;: each time interval of CNFINE is expanded by
     shifting the interval's left endpoint to the left and the right
     endpoint to the right by T seconds. Any overlapping intervals are
     merged. (The input argument CNFINE is not modified.)

     The window expansions listed below are additive: if both
     conditions apply, the window expansion amount is the sum of the
     individual amounts.

     -  If a search uses an equality constraint, the time window
        over which the state of the observer is computed is expanded
        by 1 second at both ends of all of the time intervals
        comprising the window over which the search is conducted.

     -  If a search uses stellar aberration corrections, the time
        window over which the state of the observer is computed is
        expanded as described above.

     When light time corrections are used, expansion of the search
     window also affects the set of times at which the light time-
     corrected state of the target is computed.

     In addition to the possible 2 second expansion of the search
     window that occurs when both an equality constraint and stellar
     aberration corrections are used, round-off error should be taken
     into account when the need for data availability is analyzed.

     The numerical results shown for this example may differ across
     platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as
     input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine
     specific arithmetic implementation.

     1) Determine the time windows from January 1, 2007 UTC to
        April 1, 2007 UTC for which the sun-moon range rate satisfies
        the relation conditions with respect to a reference value of
        0.3365 km/s radians (this range rate known to occur within the
        search interval). Also determine the time windows corresponding
        to the local maximum and minimum range rate, and the absolute
        maximum and minimum range rate during the search interval.

     1)  The kernel files to be used by this routine must be loaded
         (normally using the SPICELIB routine <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>) before this
         routine is called.

     2)  This routine has the side effect of re-initializing the
         range rate quantity utility package. Callers may themselves
         need to re-initialize the range rate quantity utility
         package after calling this routine.

        variables in code example.

        Updated description of WORK and RESULT arguments in $Brief_I/O,
        $Detailed_Input and $Detailed_Output.

        Added entry #10 in $Exceptions section.

        Updated header to describe use of expanded confinement window.
